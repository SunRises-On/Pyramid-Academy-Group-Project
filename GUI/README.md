# How to Run:

Run Configuration is  program from com.example.gui.Controller.Main.

## Summary

So far the program takes the data from the text.txt file and inputs it into a TableColumn (javaFX). The MenuController calls the FileModel. Which uses the File classes to transfer the data into a List. From there the FileModel transfers the list back to the MenuController. Which then transforms the List into an ArrayList<Data> which then transforms  the ArrayList<Data> into cell values.
